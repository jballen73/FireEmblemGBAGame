Welcome to I Wanna Be the Student!
This game is a challenging sidescrolling platformer designed to test your precision and patience.
You will die in this game.  A lot.  The number of times will be preserved in the top left corner of the screen
as a constant reminder.

CONTROLS:
Start: start the game (title screen only)
Select: Reset the game to the title screen
Left and Right: Movement in the corresponding direction
A: Jump/Double Jump (in midair)
R: Shoot projectile
L: Reload to previous save
B: Reload to last checkpoint

You can shoot save blocks to save your game, and then reload to restore yourself to where you were when you saved.
No, your death count does not revert to what it was then.  You can have up to 4 shots on screen at a time.

Checkpoints exist in case you save in a position where it is impossible to survive (1 pixel above a pit or spike, etc.).
A checkpoint is make automatically every 3 levels starting on level 5, and you will spawn at the beginning of the room 
the checkpoint is made in.  You will see "Checkpt" pop up on the top left of the screen when a checkpoint is reached.

Saves and checkpoints do not overwrite each other, so if you hit the wrong button by accident, nothing is lost.

Again, this game is not easy, nor is it meant to be.  Every level is beatable (I've tested it), even if it takes you many deaths.
Good luck!
