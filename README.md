This isn't really meant to be a full game, just something kind've cool.

Controls (All are in terms of the buttons on the gameboy, keys may differ depending on your emulator settings):

Map/Menu Movement: D-Pad

Select Unit/Option: A

Cancel: B

End Turn: R

Reset: Select

How to play-basics:

Select a unit, then select where you want them to go (units have limited movement, so you can't move them anywhere)

Then select wait to end their turn, or have them attack an adjacent enemy unit

Items: There are two types of items, weapons and Vulns (vulneraries):

   Weapons are necessary for combat and influence your attack power and accuracy in fights
    
   Iron Swords are less powerful but more accurate than steel swords (and have more durability, but that won't matter in this game most likely)
    If a unit has multiple weapons in their inventory, selectcing one will equip it (the equipped weapon is the one at the top of your inventory)
    Vulneraries are a 3-time use consumable item that heals 10 HP.


Combat-basics:

   The numbers you will see on screen will be the current health, damage, hit %, and crit % of each unit

   Damage is determined by the attacking unit's strength, weapon power, and defending unit's defense  
       
   This is the amount of damage you will deal to the opponent if your attack lands
   
   Hit % is determined by the attacking unit's skill, weapon accuracy, and defending unit's speed
   
   This is the chance that you will hit your opponent
   
   Crit%  is determined by the attacking unit's skill 
   
   This is the chance that you will land a critical hit (3x damage)  It is very low and there is no visual cue for it, but it's cool if it happens
   
   The attacking unit will always attack first, followed by the defending unit.  Then, if one unit is significantly faster than the other (based on their speed stat), they will get an extra attack

If a unit's health is reduced to 0, they are dead


Generally, in actual Fire Emblem games with more than one level, your units persist between levels and death is permanent, so try not to die at All

Stuff I was too lazy to put in (maybe I'll come back to it eventually):
    
   Start screen
   
   Victory/Loss Screen if all enemy/allied units die
   
   Ability to actually view your unit's stats
   
   Terrain advantage
   
   More weapons/better designed item menu (the key limiter here)

Regardless, enjoy the fruits of my suffering!

Some stats about this:

13 different methods to process the current state of the app

8 structs and 3 enums beyond what was in the template

2 different sprite sheets that are swapped between during transitions to/from combat (also required a graphics2.c to be made)

15 different app states

literally only 1 level
